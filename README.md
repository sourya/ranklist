# ranklist

**Generate ranklist for NIT Jamshedpur students branch-wise**

Because we no longer get to see our ranks in class, I wrote this program to find the rank of every person.

##Usage
```cd ``` into this directory and do the following:
Create a file (say, named ```rollfile```) and input all the roll numbers of the students in the class. All roll numbers should be entered in a new line.

Use this command to create the ranklist:

```python results.py rollfile```

Input the registration number prefix when prompted, and the semester.
Then, wait...... (It takes a long time to return results).
